    "Anchored CorEx is an extension of CorEx that allows the \"anchoring\" of words to topics. When anchoring a word to a topic, CorEx is trying to maximize the mutual information between that word and the anchored topic. So, anchoring provides a way to guide the topic model towards specific subsets of words that the user would like to explore.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The anchoring mechanism is flexible, and so there are many possibilities of anchoring. We explored the following types of anchoring in our TACL paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anchoring a single set of words to a single topic. This can help promote a topic that did not naturally emerge when running an unsupervised instance of the CorEx topic model. For example, one might anchor words like \"snow,\" \"cold,\" and \"avalanche\" to a topic if one suspects there should be a snow avalanche topic within a set of disaster relief articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anchoring single sets of words to multiple topics. This can help find different aspects of a topic that may be discussed in several different contexts. For example, one might anchor \"protest\" to three topics and \"riot\" to three other topics to understand different framings that arise from tweets about political protests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Anchoring different sets of words to multiple topics. This can help enforce topic separability if there appear to be chimera topics. For example, one might anchor \"mountain,\" \"Bernese,\" and \"dog\" to one topic and \"mountain,\" \"rocky,\" and \"colorado\" to another topic to help separate topics that merge discussion of Bernese Mountain Dogs and the Rocky Mountains.\n",
